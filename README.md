# The Pod Project

This project represents a collaboration with Dave Clark to supplement an interactive art project. Mr. Clark has created a show piece of ambient pods and wishes to introduce an opportunity for viewers to interact with the art. The approach we have taken is to employ a Raspberry Pi to display lighting effects based on motion detection.
